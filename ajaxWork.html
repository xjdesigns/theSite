        <h1>A MOMENT WITHOUT</h1>
        <h2>BORN OF FIRE</h2>
        <p>
        After a successful first project with A Moment Without, they hired me on again for the second E.P. release Born of Fire. I decided to take a different appraoch with this design. After several meetings with the guys we all decided to try push the envelope and stay away from the cliche stuff like FIRE. After the breifing we decided on doing a nebula design to represent the fire. Using Adobe software I was able to stream line my design using vector and raster elements to give it some dynamics. We went with another vibrant color pallete to help balance the blacks and contrast, it is always good to make your work pop for new music and bands. The eye catcher!!
         </p>
         <p>
            With the finished project as what you see, I believe I captured what band wanted and needed for a strong follow up disc. With several preorders we went a different approach this time by having customized bonus posters for the first 100 preorders. This also included a bonus DVD with I created, along with music video and webisodes leading up to the release. I also had the pleasure of doing all the photography for this project.

        <h1>A MOMENT WITHOUT</h1>
        <h2>A PLACE TO CALL HOME</h2>
        <p>
        In the summer of 2009, James Sanders from A Moment Without contacted me to work on there band project. Through references he was impressed and wanted to see what I could do. After first branding the band came the important part of finding the symbol that would represent the bands disc. Through several rounds of concepts with the guys, we had concepted an idea of a clock to be the symbol. After a breifing with the band I started on the creative portion of the design, creating the idea of time falling off the clock. In the midst of the chaos, the clock is falling apart representing the scene and trying to revive it. I added several key features such as Minneapolis Skyline in the clock, the deteriorating part of the clock is actually symbols of the state (Minnesota).
         </p>
         <p>
            With that idea really helped pull together the design and idea they were going for. A scene in chaos falling apart, admist the logo being top point to represent pulling it together. With the title, A Place to Call Home is a statement that we love our state and lets do this together.

        <h1>THE SALON ALLIANCE CANADA</h1>
        <h2>E-COMMERCE WEBSITE</h2>
        <p>
        During my time at G3M, I was lead front-end designer/developer for Salon Alliance Canada. This was a large scale e-commerce site for reward redemption for the KAO CA partnership program. A fully functional web UI, with several features including reward redemption, point management, shopping cart, user/admin role functions, and many others. 
         </p>
         <p>
         Site was developed off the extremely popular framework Bootstrap (or Twitter Bootstrap as many still refer it as). A very powerful framework built by the amazing people at Twitter. Site also included hand written CSS, and Jquery for extra functionality along with Highchart JS library.
         </p>
         <p>
         Using my web skills I helped create a great user-friendly UI with a strong attention to detail on the UX end of the site, with a large transition from one site to another user expereince was key with making a smooth transition without a large back lash from the user themselves. Being on the receiving end of bad UI & UX I have a strong understanding of how this can truly affect your site and reviews and return visits.

            Created a brand focused web design, driven for recognition as well as a better sense of the brand you are apart of.

            <p>
            <h5>BOOTSTRAP FRAMEWORK</h5>
            The almight and powerful Bootstrap was used for the frameworks and several functions for a great user experience, so many props goes out to the Twitter crew for such a great creation.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h5>CSS & JQUERY</h5>
            Along with the framework, many handwritten css elements were added for the brand focus and several styles Bootstrap did not have built in. Extra Jquery was written for more functionaliy such as the slide down menu and verification add-ons.

        <h1>GANNETT PUBLISHING SERVICES</h1>
        <h2>COLLATERAL PROJECT</h2>
        <p>
        While working at Gannett Offset MPLS I had many roles within the Premedia department. One was being an in-house designer for the company, one of the projects assigned was to work with the new sales staff to create a new look and feel for the company. Being an offsite of a large corporation we had to develop for in-house and corporate use. Several meetings in we decided to do a tri-fold brochure which could be printed in-house, this was key as it would also show what our quality is like outputted.
         </p>
         <p>
         Sticking to the corporate colors branded by Gannett, we incorporated this to create a solid brand but also added in the elements we do in our facility. Being the only heat-set offset printer under the corporate badge we had many things to add to the list as a whole. All photography was done in-house by myself using a Nikon D3000, using natural lighting.
         </p>
         <p>
         I also help update the website with current CSS methods and removing tables and extra code not needed. Very basic project and one of my first web projects. You can visit it <a class="black" href="http://www.mplsoffset.com/index.html">HERE.</a>
