        <h1>A MOMENT WITHOUT</h1>
        <h2>BORN OF FIRE</h2>
        <p>
        After a successful first project with A Moment Without, they hired me on again for the second E.P. release Born of Fire. I decided to take a different appraoch with this design. After several meetings with the guys we all decided to try push the envelope and stay away from the cliche stuff like FIRE. After the breifing we decided on doing a nebula design to represent the fire. Using Adobe software I was able to stream line my design using vector and raster elements to give it some dynamics. We went with another vibrant color pallete to help balance the blacks and contrast, it is always good to make your work pop for new music and bands. The eye catcher!!

        With the finished project as what you see, I believe I captured what band wanted and needed for a strong follow up disc. With several preorders we went a different approach this time by having customized bonus posters for the first 100 preorders. This also included a bonus DVD with I created, along with music video and webisodes leading up to the release. I also had the pleasure of doing all the photography for this project.
